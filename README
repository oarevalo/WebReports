WebReports
=========
https://github.com/oarevalo/WebReports

This is a tool to generate and interact with web-based reports.

*Originally developed by CFEmpire corp (Anabel Fernandez and Oscar Arevalo)*

Requirements:
----------------------
- Railo 3 or higher, Adobe Coldfusion 8 or higher
- MySQL 5 or higher (other SQL-based databases should work fine, you just need to add the proper SQL script to generate the tables)


Setup:
---------
1. Unpack to a directory named "/WebReports"
2. Create a datasource named "webreports"
3. Run the sql script provided on /WebReports/install/mysql.sql  (for other databases you will need to translate to the appropriate dialect)
4. Go to /WebReports in your browser. The app will ask you to create the admin user.

The starting point is the Portal, from here follow the links to access the Report Designer (create new reports) 
or the Report Viewer (view and interact with existing reports)


Configuration:
-------------------
The main configuration file is located at /WebReports/common/config/apps-config.xml

To restrict the datasources that can be used to generate reports, change the
<allowedDatasources /> setting to the list of the datasources you wish to allow for report generation.

To change the location where reports are saved, change the <reportRepositoryPath /> setting.


Integration Samples:
-----------------------------
Several demos and integration code samples are located in /WebReports/docs/samples/

To run the demos you need to first generate the sample data. To do this first run the mysql script 
in /WebRepors/docs/samples/install/demo_tables_mysql.sql, and then go to /WebRepors/docs/samples/install/setup.cfm 
in your browser to generate the data.
