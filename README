WebReports
https://github.com/oarevalo/WebReports

This is a tool to generate and interact with web-based reports.

Originally developed by CFEmpire corp (Anabel Fernandez and Oscar Arevalo)

Requirements:
- Railo 3 or higher, Adobe Coldfusion 8 or higher
- MySQL 5 or higher (other SQL-based databases should work fine, you just need to add the proper SQL script to generate the tables)

Setup:
1. Unpack to a directory named "/WebReports"
2. Create a datasource named "webreports"
3. Run the sql script provided on /WebReports/install/mysql.sql  (for other databases you will need to translate to the appropriate dialect)
4. Go to /WebReports in your browser. The app will ask you to create the admin user.

To restrict the datasources that can be used to generate reports, edit /WebReports/common/config/apps-config.xml; changed the
<allowedDatasources /> setting to the list of the datasources you wish to allow for report generation.

Several demos and integration code samples are located in /WebReports/docs/samples/

To generate the sample data, run the mysql script in /WebRepors/docs/samepls/install/demo_tables_mysql.sql,
and then go to /WebRepors/docs/samepls/install/setup.cfm in your browser to generate the data.
